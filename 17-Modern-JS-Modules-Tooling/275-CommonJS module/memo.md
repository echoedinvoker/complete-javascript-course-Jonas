## Other module systems which relied on some external implementations

- AMD module
- CommonJS module

## CommonJS module

#### _history_

- CoomonJS module exists almost anywhere in NodeJS.
- Because npm has become the standard repository for whole JavaScript, it no longer exists just for NodeJS.
  - So we are now basically stuck with CommonJS...

#### Code example

- CommonJS is just like ES6 module, one file, one module.

- The code below is only used as an example and cannot really be executed because CommonJS is not installed here.
